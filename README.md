# Tree Height Calculator using Shadows

This repository contains a simple Python script to calculate the height of a tree based on the principle of similar triangles. By providing the height of a known object (like a stick) and the lengths of their respective shadows, users can deduce the height of the tree. Great for educational purposes and practical real-world measurements!

## How to use

1. Run the `tree_height_calculator.py` script.
2. Enter the length of the stick (in meters).
3. Enter the length of the stick's shadow (in meters).
4. Enter the length of the tree's shadow (in meters).
5. The script will output the calculated height of the tree.

## Principle

The principle behind this is the similarity of triangles. When the sun casts shadows, the angles of elevation from the tips of the shadows to the top of the objects (stick and tree) are the same. By knowing the height of one object (the stick) and the lengths of the shadows, we can deduce the height of the second object (the tree).
