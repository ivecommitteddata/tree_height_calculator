# tree_height_calculator
This repository contains a simple Python script to calculate the height of a tree based on the principle of similar triangles. By providing the height of a known object (like a stick) and the lengths of their respective shadows, users can deduce the height of the tree. Great for educational purposes and practical real-world measurements
